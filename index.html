    Governments and law enforcement are increasingly using technology and algorithms to predict where and when illegal activities are likely to occur. The fast-paced implementation of these predictive systems has them silently entering the public realm without discussion of their implications and adverse effects; solidifying structural inequality, creating new geographies of violence and dimensions of exclusion.
    <br><br>
    To address these matters and further questions of organising public safety and security in the age of big data, the students and staff of the master <a href="https://www.kabk.nl/en/programmes/master/non-linear-narrative" target="_blank">Non-Linear Narrative</a> of the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague have organised this symposium, bringing together in conversation a diversity of professional perspectives, including philosophers, academics, designers, and information technology experts.
